# StoichiometricBalance
Given 1) a protein interaction network, with interfaces resolved and 2) Copy numbers for some of the proteins, Quantify degree of stoichiometric balance in protein copy numbers.

Also requires a distribution of protein copy numbers for the organism, to sample 'random' copy numbers for each protein and establish the significance of the observed copy numbers. 
Distributions available for yeast and human copy numbers.
