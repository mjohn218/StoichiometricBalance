To run code

../../bin/stoich_balance.exe parms.inp proList_abundance_good.txt toy_Network_4col.txt >r1.out


Inputs:

parms_cme.inp:	     Parameters for the simulation. Includes number of proteins, minimum number of complexes 
		     each interface must participate in, number of times to run randomized copy numbers--for p-value. 
		     a flag which determined whether random copy numbers are sampled or shuffled from real values. 
		     the alpha scaling parameter.
		     maximum complexes: default set to zero indicates no upper bound (or infinity). 
		    
proList_abundance_good.txt:	Protein name, Copy numbers, and IsConstrained? 
				IsConstrained: Yes means balance shouldl be close as possible to defined copy numbers, 
				IsConstrained: No means that interfaces still add up to partners, but,
					       copy numbers are not constrained to be close to the starting observed values.

toy_Network_4col.txt:    List of protein-interface interactions. Four Columns: Pro1 Iface1 Pro2 Iface2
