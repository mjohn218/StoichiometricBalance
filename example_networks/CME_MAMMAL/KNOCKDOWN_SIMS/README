TO run the original network, and then perform single knockdowns of each protein:

./stoich_balance_knockdowns.exe parms_hela.txt ProteinList_CONSENSUSHeLa_CME.txt Network_5col_Jan2020_proOnly.txt -all >std.out


To run the original network, and then perform knockdown of a specific set of proteins, list 
the set of proteins to knockdown in the 4th input file. 
Example knockdown of all AP-2 subunits: kd_apsubunits.txt

./stoich_balance_knockdowns.exe parms_hela.txt ProteinList_CONSENSUSHeLa_CME.txt Network_5col_Jan2020_proOnly.txt kd_apsubunits.txt >std.out
