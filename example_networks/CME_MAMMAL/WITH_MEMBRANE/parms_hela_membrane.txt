86	# Number of proteins (includes lipids and cargo)
50	# min number of complexes (determines min number of interface copies as well).
1	#alpha: default 1, lower value biases towards equal interfaces copies within a protein.
100	#Number of times to perform randomized copy numbers: 0 will only do Real copy numbers
1	#Flag only applies to randomized copy numbers: 1 means: sample Copy Nums.  0 means shuffle CNs
0 	# OPTIONAL: Maximum number of complexes, default is Infinity, by setting to "0".
