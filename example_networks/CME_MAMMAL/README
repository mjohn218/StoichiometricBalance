Inputs:

parms_help.inp:	     Parameters for the simulation. Includes number of proteins, minimum number of complexes 
		     each interface must participate in, number of times to run randomized copy numbers--for p-value. 
		     a flag which determined whether random copy numbers are sampled or shuffled from real values. 
		     the alpha scaling parameter.
		     maximum complexes: default set to zero indicates no upper bound (or infinity). 
		    
ProteinList_Hein_CME_HeLa.txt:	Protein name, Copy numbers, and IsConstrained? 
				IsConstraine: Yes means balance shouldl be close as possible to defined copy numbers, 
				IsConstrained: No means that interfaces still add up to partners, but,
					       copy numbers are not constrained to be close to the starting observed values.
Network_CME_MAMMALS_4col.txt:    List of protein-interface interactions. Four Columns: Pro1 Iface1 Pro2 Iface2

Hein_CellTypeHeLa_CopyNumberCDF.txt:   OPTIONAL: Cell Type Protein Copy Number distribution.  This is used to determine a p-value, but initializing
				  copy numbers based on sampling from this distribution.
				  Left columns: bins for copy numbers. Right column: Cumulative distribution function.


MAIN OUTPUT:
RealCopyNumbers_vsBalancedCopyNumbers.txt: 	List of each protein and interface. List of starting copy numbers (R), 
						balanced interface copy numbers (R'), and balanced copy numbers per protein (R'')
						by averaging over all interfaces for that protein. Finally, prints the variance for (R') 
						for multi-interface proteins.
	

std.out :		This will tell you what edges were including in the balance calculation, what are the properties of the proteins, 
			the Interface Network Used for the proteins in ProteinList_..txt file. Reports the Parameters used as well.
