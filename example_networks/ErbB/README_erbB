../../bin/stoich_balance.exe parms_ErbB.inp ErbB_ProteinList_Hela.txt ErbB_Network_fourCol.txt HeLa_Kulak_CopyNumberCDF.txt >r1.out



Inputs:

parms_ErbB.inp:	     Parameters for the simulation. Includes number of proteins, minimum number of complexes 
		     each interface must participate in, number of times to run randomized copy numbers--for p-value. 
		     a flag which determined whether random copy numbers are sampled or shuffled from real values. 
		     the alpha scaling parameter.
		     maximum complexes: default set to zero indicates no upper bound (or infinity). 
		    
ErbB_ProteinList_Hela.txt:	Protein name, Copy numbers, and IsConstrained? 
				IsConstraine: Yes means balance shouldl be close as possible to defined copy numbers, 
				IsConstrained: No means that interfaces still add up to partners, but,
					       copy numbers are not constrained to be close to the starting observed values.
ErbB_Network_fourCol.txt:    List of protein-interface interactions. Four Columns: Pro1 Iface1 Pro2 Iface2

HeLa_Kulak_CopyNumberCDF.txt:   OPTIONAL: Hela Cell copy number distribution.  This is used to determine a p-value, but initializing
				  copy numbers based on sampling from this distribution.
				  Left columns: bins for copy numbers. Right column: Cumulative distribution function.


MAIN OUTPUT:
RealCopyNumbers_vsBalancedCopyNumbers.txt: 	List of each protein and interface. List of starting copy numbers (R), 
						balanced interface copy numbers (R'), and balanced copy numbers per protein (R'').
						R'' is simply calculated by averaging over all interface copy number (R') for that protein. 
						Finally, prints the variance for (R') for multi-interface proteins.
	


in r1.out: These inputs are found to have 540 edges, 377 interfaces, and 115 constrained proteins, out of 127 specified proteins in the network.
